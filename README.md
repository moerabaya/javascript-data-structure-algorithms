## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of commonly used data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Whether you're studying for technical interviews or looking to strengthen your understanding of fundamental computer science concepts, this repository can serve as a valuable resource.

## Data Structures

Here's a list of data structures currently implemented in this repository:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Graph

Each data structure comes with its implementation along with methods to manipulate and interact with the data structure.

## Algorithms

Here's a list of algorithms currently implemented in this repository:

- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Search)
- Dynamic Programming algorithms
- String manipulation algorithms
- And more!

Each algorithm comes with its implementation along with comments explaining the algorithm's logic and time complexity.
